# Welcome to ECSE321 Project Group 04 :dizzy:

The goal of the project is to create a website and an Android application to facilitate the pet donation operations hosted by the local pet shelter. 
Users will be able to register to the system, upload their information and post advertisements about pets they want to put into adoption or look for pets they would like to adopt. 
The system will serve as a platform for users to exchange messages, pictures and comments about the pets put into adoption or about the pets they wish to adopt. 
Users will also be able to make voluntary donations to the Pet Shelter.
